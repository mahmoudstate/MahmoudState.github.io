        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and once hot add the beef mince and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook the mince until well browned over a medium-high heat (be careful not to burn the mince. It just needs to be a dark brown colour). Once browned, transfer the mince to a bowl and set aside.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add another tablespoon of oil to the saucepan you browned the mince in and turn the heat to medium. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and fry gently for 5-6 minutes, or until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the grated carrot then pour the mince and any juices in the bowl back into the saucepan.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well to mix. Pour in the stock, bring to a simmer and then reduce the temperature to simmer gently for 45 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and rich. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> When ready to cook the spaghetti, heat a large saucepan of water and add a pinch of salt. Cook according to the packet instructions. Once the spaghetti is cooked through, drain and add to the pan with the bolognese sauce. Mix well and serve.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flour, semolina and salt. Stir in the dried yeast (or crumble in the fresh yeast). Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and pour in most of the water along with the olive oil. Bring the dough together with your hands or a wooden spoon. As the flour is incorporated, the dough will start to take shape. Add the remaining water if the dough feels tight or hard.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and knead for 10 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. Cut off a small piece of the dough and stretch part of it as thinly as you can. If you can see the shadow of your fingers through the dough (the light should shine through the dough like a window pane) without it tearing, it is ready to prove.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Knead the cut piece back into the dough and shape the dough into an even ball. Place in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and allow to prove in a warm place for 1–1½ hours, or until it has doubled in size (the temperature of your kitchen can affect the timing of this).</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> When the dough has risen, take it out of the bowl and knock the air out. Divide the dough into two equal portions, and shape each portion into a ball. Cover with a damp cloth and allow to prove again for about 15 minutes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Place a pizza stone or an upturned baking tray into the oven and preheat to its highest setting.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Dust the work surface liberally with semolina. Roll out one piece of the dough to form a circle that will fit on your pizza stone or baking tray.</p>
        
         <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Transfer the pizza base onto a plastic chopping board (or another upturned baking tray) dusted with semolina. The tray will be used to slide the pizza base directly onto the pizza stone.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Cover the surface with half of the tomato sauce and toppings of your choice.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> When ready to bake, slide the pizza directly onto the pizza stone and cook for 8–10 minutes, or until the base is golden-brown and the toppings are bubbling. Repeat with the remaining dough, tomato sauce and toppings.</p>
